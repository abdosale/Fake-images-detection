# Fake Image Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to detect fake images generated by AI tools and determine their authenticity.
By leveraging transfer learning with pretrained models, 
we aim to create an effective and efficient solution for distinguishing between real and AI-generated images.

# Installation
To get started with the Fake Image Detection project, you will need to install the required dependencies. We recommend using a virtual environment to manage these dependencies.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
pip install numpy scikit-learn opencv-python tensorflow  # or pytorch


To use the fake image detection model, follow these steps:

# Prepare the Data:
Follow the instructions in the Data Preparation section to prepare your dataset.
Train the Model:
Train the model using the provided scripts in the Model Training section.
Run Predictions:
Use the trained model to predict the authenticity of new images.


#  Data Preparation
Our dataset is created using a unique methodology and API tools. Here is how you can prepare the data:

Collect Real Images:

Use various sources to collect a diverse set of real images.
Generate Fake Images:

Use AI tools to generate fake images. Ensure a variety of AI tools are used to increase dataset diversity.
Preprocess the Data:

Use OpenCV and other preprocessing tools to standardize the dataset.


#  Model Training
We use transfer learning with pretrained models for this project. Here are the steps to train the model:

Load Pretrained Model:

Use a pretrained model such as VGG16, ResNet50, etc.
Fine-tune the Model:

Fine-tune the model with your dataset.
